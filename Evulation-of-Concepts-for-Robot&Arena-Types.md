# Evulation of Concepts for Robot & Arena Types

### Evulation Criterias

  **1. Cost:** The budget is limited, and minimizing the budget is important.
  
  **2. Size:** Minimal design are important for this project.
  
  **3. Weight:** Weight is important for mobility of robots and arena.
  
  **4. Durability:** A sustainable system is important for this project.
  
  **5. Stability:** Stability is needed for proper image processing and search algorithm practices.
  
  **6. Energy Consumption:** Energy consumption is important for the robots' total operating time without charging. 
  
  **7. Resource Accessibility:** Resources should be accessible to create a sustainable system.
  
  **8. Feasibility:** Solutions should be feasible.  

# Weight Factors and Decision Matrices
  ### a. Scenario Adapter Device
  
The possible solutions for this part are:
* Projector
* Monitor
* Imaginary Arena

Criterias and their corresponding weight factors are given in the following Chart 1.

Criteria | Weight Factor
-------- | ---------
Cost | C1.1 = 0.4
Durability | C1.2 = 0.2
Stability | C1.3 = 0.2
Resource Accessibility | C1.4 = 0.2
Total | C1 = 1
###### Chart 1 

* Cost = Compare costs of the components, since budget is limited.
* Durability = Compare durabilities of the components, since sustainability is desired in this project.
* Stability = Compare stabilities of the components, since continuity is important while using arena.
* Resource Accessibility = Accessible resources are advantageous in a renewal process.

The Hierarchical Objective Tree for this part is available in Chart 2.
