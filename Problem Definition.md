# Problem Definition

In ME461 lecture, students must practice search algorithm and image processing problems. In order to
eliminate the preparation  process for the required domain, that will provide an area to students to
practice search algorithm and image processing, mechatronics laboratory  needs a sustainable area for
this purpose. In this project a software, which manages the restrictions and requirements for certain
scenarios, and a robot arena, which provides the required domain to implement the specified scenarios
in real-life, will be build.
