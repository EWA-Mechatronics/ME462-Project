## Robot Arena Concepts

***1. Wireless Controlled Robot with Projector***

Robots will be controlled by means of a wireless communication protocol. Positions of the robots will be 
acquired using a camera above the platform. The competition arena will be projected on the surface. Robots 
will have a battery and will be able to charge themselves when necessary.

***2. Wireless Controlled Robot with Monitor***

Robots will be controlled by means of a wireless communication protocol. Positions of the robots will be 
acquired using a camera above the platform. The competition arena will be displayed on a monitor. Robots will 
be placed on this monitor. Robots will have a battery and will be able to charge themselves when necessary.

***3. Robot Actuated with Electromagnets on a Frictionless Platform***

Arena will have electromagnets beneath the surface. The surface will be made frictionless by providing an airflow
through the holes on the surface (Similar to an air hockey table). Robots, which will have ferromagnetic property, 
will be pushed and pulled by activating certain electromagnets. Thus, robots will not require any battery or a 
microcontroller on them.

***4. Robot Controlled using Photoresistors***

In this concept, the arena will be a monitor. Robots will have photoresistors placed underneath. These sensors 
will read the light level on a certain place on the monitor. The monitor will be controlled to adjust these light
levels as required. Robots will use the sensor feedback to move in the desired direction. Robots may or may not 
have a microcontroller.

***5. Robot with a Conveyor as an Actuator***

A conveyor type of structure will be designed and placed underneath the arena. This conveyor will carry an 
electromagnet to pull the robot in desired direction. Robots will have ferromagnetic property, but no microcontroller
or battery is necessary.

***6. Robot Actuated with Three Propeller on a Frictionless Platform***

The arena will be similar to an air hockey table. Robots will have three propellers placed on them with 120 degrees 
angle between. By controlling the airflow by these propellers, the robots will be transported in the desired direction.

***7. Robot Powered Using a Mesh Above the Platform (Bumper car style)***

This concept eliminates the need to charge the batteries by placing a wire mesh above the arena. This mesh will have 
a potential difference with the ground. Robots will connect the mesh and the ground, and the current flow through the 
robot will provide the power necessary to run the robot. 

***8. Robot Controlled with Actuated Wings on a Frictionless Platform***

The arena will be similar to an air hockey table. Robots will have actuated wings on them. By using these wings, the 
air flow will be directed in a certain direction and the robot will move as desired.
