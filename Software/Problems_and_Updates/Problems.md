# About Problems File

Main aim of this file is recording observed problems of the software part,
since with the increase of the number of lines in py files, problem tracking became very problematic. Solved problems will be deleted, and 
they can be tracked from the [Updates](https://github.com/EWA-Mechatronics/ME462-Project/blob/master/Software/Problems_and_Updates/Updates.md) file.
