# What is Webots ?

Webots is a open source professional mobile robot simulation software package. 
It offers a rapid prototyping environment, that allows the user to create 3D virtual worlds with physics properties.
Users can add obstacles and robots to the simulation. Moreover, robots may be equipped with a number of sensor and actuator devices,
such as distance sensors, drive wheels, cameras, motors, touch sensors, etc.
Finally, users can program each robot individually.

# Getting Started to the Webots

It is essantial to understand the Webots to understand√º this project, since in this project we will also build a simulaiton
to simulate the same processes from the real world. Moreover, we will use this simulation to get desired sensor values. Finally, we want to use
the power of being the open source with Webots.
